### Here are some of the most common .img files that you might find in a firmware package:
boot.img: This file contains the kernel, which is the core component of the operating system that manages system resources such as memory, CPU, and input/output. The kernel is responsible for loading the operating system and starting the device.

recovery.img: This file contains a small operating system called the recovery system, which is used to recover the device if the main operating system fails or becomes corrupted. The recovery system provides tools for wiping the device, installing updates, and backing up and restoring data.

system.img: This file contains the main operating system, which is responsible for providing the user interface and running apps on the device. The system image includes the Android framework, libraries, and system apps.

cache.img: This file contains the cache partition, which is used to store temporary files that are created by apps and the operating system.

userdata.img: This file contains the user data partition, which is used to store user data such as app data, contacts, messages, and media files.
